- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or [SQL Server LocalDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TaskManagementSystem.git
cd TaskManagementSystem
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up the Backend (`TaskManagementSystem.API`)

#### Navigate to the API folder:
```bash
cd TaskManagementSystem.API
```

#### Restore NuGet packages:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

#### Apply EF Core migrations (optional if DB schema is already created):
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

#### Run the API:
```bash
dotnet run
```

By default, the API will run on:
```
https://localhost:7077
http://localhost:5100
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up the Frontend (`TaskManagementSystem.UI`)

#### Navigate to the UI folder:
```bash
cd ../TaskManagementSystem.UI
```

#### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

#### Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the UI will run on:
```
http://localhost:9000
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration

You can update environment variables in the following files:

- **Frontend:** `/TaskManagementSystem.UI/.env`  
  Example:
  ```env
  VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://localhost:7077/api

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (Run Both Frontend & Backend Together)

You can run both projects simultaneously using two terminals or a single command with [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently).

### Option 1: Two separate terminals
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Run backend
cd TaskManagementSystem.API
dotnet run

# Terminal 2 - Run frontend
cd TaskManagementSystem.UI
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Single command with concurrently
1. Install `concurrently` in the root folder:
```bash
npm install -g concurrently
```

2. Create a script in the **root package.json**:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently \"cd TaskManagementSystem.API && dotnet run\" \"cd TaskManagementSystem.UI && npm run dev\""
}
```

3. Run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend and frontend in one go.
